# Mount custom ISO
You can use the feature to install the operating system from custom ISO. To do so, you need to create a virtual machine first. For simplicity, you can choose to create the vm from Centos 7.1.

After you have created the vm, make sure it is turned off and click more:

![Choose iso insert](./images/mount-iso/choose.png)

Then choose an ISO from the list of available ones:
![List](./images/mount-iso/list.png)

After that start the vm and connect to VNC:

![VNC](./images/mount-iso/vnc.png)

When you have finished instaling the OS, do not forget to do ISO eject (switch off the vm before doing it):

![ISO eject](./images/mount-iso/eject.png)
